# Battleship Pirate ☠
Battleship Pirate ☠ is a little java game I made as a school project @ NTNU.
You find a pre-made board [here](https://github.com/balazsorban44/battleship-pirate/blob/master/save1.pir)
Download it, make sure the extension is `.pir`, and then you can import it into the game by the button `Another day for a good fight`

I really liked it, so I decided to dedicate a repository for it.
#### Enjoy!
